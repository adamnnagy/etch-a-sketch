## intructions

### the grid
Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
- make the grids adjustable with a range slider https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp
    - 1x1 to 100x100
- all divs have a class
- event listener to grid
- the event changes the color of the current target
- hover on the grid items -- so i know i can interact with them if i go over them with my mouse -- could be a simple "border"


### different brushes
- classic gray
- random colors
- eraser
- import nice colors from a color palette generator (outside library)

### how to change colors
- change background color of the divs through JS

### other functions
- could implement the animation repeat, that would make the drawing glow

## UI
- a screen (the grid)
- the different brushes
- the animation on off switch
- add touchend and touchstart for mobile
- 

## extras
- can save 3 pics and store them in session storage
    - save and load functions
    - store the grid as an array
